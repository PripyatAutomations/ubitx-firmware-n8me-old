This is my modifications to N8ME's firmware.

I'm not sure where to find him so, i've thrown this up on github.
* Edit * I've reached out to him on groups.io! hopefully he's made more progress!

I've added Makefiles building, as I dislike Arduino IDE... It might still build in arduino, idk

Edit  include/defines.h to set features and include/owner.h to set bandplan and callsign.

Run make

Good luck!
